# smart-dustbin
A smart waste management system using IoT and microcontrollers that automatically detects and segregates waste. The project integrates sensors for detecting bin fullness, automated lid control, and optional data monitoring via a cloud dashboard for efficient waste disposal. Designed for educational and prototyping purposes.
Key Features:

Automatic lid opening using a servo motor when waste is detected.

Waste level detection with ultrasonic sensors.

Indicator system to notify when the bin is full.

Simulated and tested in Proteus before hardware implementation.

Components Used:

Microcontroller: Arduino UNO or ESP32 (for controlling sensors and motors)

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): Detects distance to waste and bin fill level

Servo Motor: Opens and closes the dustbin lid automatically

LEDs / Buzzer: Indicate bin full status

Resistors, Breadboard, and Wires: For circuit connections

Proteus Software: For simulation and testing the circuit before real-world deployment

Optional Advanced Features:

Cloud integration for real-time monitoring.

Segregation of waste (dry/wet) using additional sensors.
